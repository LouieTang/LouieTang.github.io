    <p>Currently applying everything I already know about WebDev into creating this website. Ideally, this will be the place where I constantly write the things I am working on, what I am looking forewards to in the future, updates to this website, and things I learn day in day out when it comes to programming. <br>
    Please stay tuned!</p>
