            <h2>Private Tutor</h2>
            <h4>Self-Employed</h4>
            <h5>October 2021 - Present</h5>
            <p>I have been tutoring since October 2021, teaching various subjects. The notible ones are: Mathematics up to AP Calculus, Physics up to AP Physics C, Chemistry up to Chemistry 12. I have taught around 150 hours, and am open to additional clientel. My teaching philosophy has always been to tailor lessons with the student's needs in mind and finding ways to best convey the topic at hand. Communication with the students and the parents is critical in how I successfully mentor these students. I always put additional time into crafting lesson plans beforehand and write a summary after each session. I have always had a passion for helping others, and the success of the students I mentor brings me joy. For inquiries, please contact me by email at Louietang03@gmail.com.</p>
