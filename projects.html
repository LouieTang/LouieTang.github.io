                    <p>Highlights: This project was the first deliverable of my CPEN 321 - Software Engineering course. In a span of two weeks, I was able to learn and create an android application that encapsulated the workings of android application development. I learned how to set up an AWS server and using the Express framework, I established communication between an android device and the my server. Furthermore, I had implement my own functionality: a QR code scanner that scans an uploaded image for QR codes and displays the result. I decided to implement this functionality as there is no such functionality built into either android or apple. Instead of having to share a screenshot of the QR code to a different device before scanning the code, my application takes that static screenshot and returns it's contents directly.</p>

                    <p>Highlights: This project was my first project within my course CPEN 311 - Digital Systems Design. Our first task was to create a Baccarat game with some skeleton code, and a breif description of the game itself. From this project, I build on my knowledge about combinational and sequential logic, and learned about multi-clock behaviour. Furthermore, I was able to hone my skills in creating testbenches for verification to confirm that my system was performing as intended. Finally, using an FPGA board, I was able to simulate the System Verilog code into an actual working game.</p>

                    <p>My Contributions: As a front-end and back-end developer for this project, I was responsible for the UI/UX, and the integration of the back-end server. I managed the process of creating, setting up, and retaining the front-end which was hosted on Apache2. Furthermore, I created and managed the backend Api Uris to ensure interactions between our back-end server and clients were operational. From this project, I was able to exercise my leadership abilities, project management, and self learning skills. Furthermore, this project came with it's challenges, from time management, to workload distribution, all of which were managed accordingly and professionally.

                    Aside: A special thank you to the course instructor for giving me permission to make this project public. It could not have been possible without the support and tools given to us during our labs and outside of class. Another thank you goes to my groupmates who spent many hours with me working on this project. This current GitHub is an addition to what we had built together, with additional functionalities (currently in progress).</p>

                    <p class="tech-skills">Description: An escalation of six labs/assignments. Started from datapaths, and logic, to decoders, to ALUs, to a functioning simple processor.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Highlights: The Simple Processor was created over a series of seven lab assignments in my first term as a computer engineering student. The course was CPEN 211 - Computing Systems I, and the labs themselves built up towards a simple processor using System Verilog. From this project, I was able to create a processor that incorperated model RAM - which stored instructions and data within a .txt file, model CPU - which had a decoder, controller, and datapath, and a model ALU - which did simple arithmetic. Together, the simple processor was able to read instructions from another .txt file. From this project, I was able to learn how to integrate multiple modules using System Verilog, and how delicate the process of connecting parts is.</p>
