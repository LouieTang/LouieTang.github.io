                <p class="tech-skills">Languages Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Python</p>
                <p class="tech-skills">Frameworks Used: Bootstrap, PyTorch</p>

                <p>This project is the project I am most proud of to date. This was a project within my course CPEN 291 - Computer Engineering Design Studio I, which in a team of four, was assigned to creating a full stack project of our choice. Within two months, this was my introduction to the intricate details of creating a project that required a server and using git (GitHub) to manage the project. Our website was hosted using apache2, and we had a backend VM which we ran on the UBC ECE server. My contributions to this project were designing the entirety of the frontend user interface, maintaining our server, and website, as well as integrating all of our parts. Overall, I was able to hone my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills; learn how to use Node.js to handle HTTP requests, and have an introduction to machine learning using Pytorch.</p>

                <p>The Dancing Robot was a project within my course CPEN 291 - Computer Engineering Design Studio I. In a group of four, we were tasked with assembling a robot that could produce original dance maneuvers. The robot itself was controlled using a Raspberry Pi Pico board which could control several devices, including four servo motors that were used to control the legs of our robot. The skeleton of our robot was provided to us, however, the functionality was up to us to decide. I was assigned to the calibration of the dance moves by using the CircuitPython framework. Furthermore, I was in charge of integrating everything together, as well as keeping my group on schedule and focused. Overall, I was able to take on a large leadership role, creating a quality product for our assessment by the course staff.</p>

                <p>My personal website, as seen here, has been a work in progress ever since secondary school. It has been through many different versions, and this version is the current one. The project itself started as a means to learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, however it is now a landing page for those who would like to learn more about me. Although this will not be the last version of my website, it is a representation of what I have learned over the years up to this point.</p>

                <p class="tech-skills">Tools Used: Git</p>
                <p>The Simple Processor was created over a series of seven lab assignments in my first term as a computer engineering student. The course was CPEN 211 - Computing Systems I, and the labs themselves built up towards a simple processor using SystemVerilog. From this project, I was able to create a processor that incorperated model RAM - which stored instructions and data within a .txt file, model CPU - which had a decoder, controller, and datapath, and a model ALU - which did simple arithmetic. Together, the simple processor was able to read instructions from another .txt file. From this project, I was able to learn how to integrate multiple modules using SystemVerilog, and how delicate the process of connecting parts is.</p>

                <p>This project was the first deliverable of my CPEN 321 - (Advanced) Software Engineering course. In a span of two weeks, I was able to learn and create an android application that encapsulated the workings of android application development. I learned how to set up an AWS server and through using the Express framework, I established communication between a device and the my server. Furthermore, I had implement my own functionality: a QR code scanner that scans an uploaded image for QR codes and displays the result. As there is no such functionality built into either android or apple, instead of having to share a screenshot of the QR code to a different device before scanning the code, my application would take the screenshot and return it's contents.</p>

                <p>This is an ongoing project as part of my CPEN 331 - Operating Systems course. It is modeled off the Harvard University course CS161, and I am currently implementing various different functionalities within my own operating system. From this I will learn the workings of an operating system, how systems are integrated together to create an interface that users can use to perform instructions to the hardware.</p>

                <p class="tech-skills">Tools Used: Git</p>
                <p>This project was my first project within my course CPEN 311 - Digital Systems Design. Our first task was to create a Baccarat game with some skeleton code, and a breif description of the game itself. From this project, I build on my knowledge about combinational and sequential logic, and learned about multi-clock behaviour. Furthermore, I was able to hone my skills in creating testbenches for verification to confirm that my system was performing as intended. Finally, using an FPGA board, I was able to simulate the SystemVerilog code into an actual working game.</p>
