                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the showcase of Grocery Manager. This project is a comprehensive mobile application designed to simplify your shopping experience and eliminate food waste. This app goes beyond basic list-keeping, ensuring you never let another perishable item expire. Enjoy features like real-time chat with certified dietitians for personalized advice, and let the app generate recipes based on your current inventory. Grocery Manager is your all-in-one solution, effortlessly managing your items and offering culinary inspiration to make meal planning a breeze.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>To provide context, this three month project is a part of the CPEN 321 curriculum, in which in a group of four, we were tasked with creating a mobile application that met a certain complexity, and followed standard software development procedures. Grocery Manager is a take on addressing the problem of managing perishable food items. It takes the hassle away from deciding what to cook every day, and ensures one stays on top of their items so that knowing expiry dates and when to use what items is never an issue.</p>

            <section id="objectives">
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
                <p>The main objectives of Grocery Manager are to explore software development procedures, and mobile (Android) development.</p>
            </section>
    
            <section id="methodology">
                <h2>Methodology/Approach</h2>
                <p>In developing Grocery Manager, we employed an agile/waterfall hybrid work approach, utilizing Java in the front-end, and Node.js in the backend to achieve our goals. The development process involved careful planning, prototyping, revision, and constant evaluation.</p>
            </section>
    
            <section id="features">
                <h2>Features/Functionalities</h2>
                <p>The key features of Grocery Manager include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inventory Management, Notifications and Tracking.</li>
                    <li>Recipe Generation.</li>
                    <li>Real Time Chat with a Dietician.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>These features are designed to ensure one knows exactly what they have at a time. Furthermore, notifications are sent every time items are about to expire. Inventory habits (frequency, items, etc.) are tracked within an algorithm such that an algorithm can let the user know when it is time to restock on an item. 
                <br>
                <br>
                A set of recipes are generated for the user to have a set of options to choose from when deciding what they want to cook for a meal. This set of recipes are catered towards what is already within the inventory the user provides.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, there is a real time chat feature with a dietician, where a user is able to chat and connect with a dietician for dietary instructions, or advice.
