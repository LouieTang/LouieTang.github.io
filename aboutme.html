                    <p>What began as a hobby for meeting new people quickly became a small obsession. I currently play for the Varsity B team and a local club here in Vancouver.</p>

                    <p>I have learned up to RCM level 10 and I currently play/practice when I have the time. Music has been apart of my life for more than 15 years and counting.</p>

                    <p>I once played competatively, but now am merely a casual player. I am always up for a friendly game of chess.</p>

                    <p>I am constantly learning. There is something enjoyable about learning new things, discovering interesting facts, and ultimately becoming a little more knowledgable about the universe.</p>

                    <h4 class="center-text">Design</h4>
                    <p>I have always enjoyed the design process of the projects I have worked on. These range from software project designs (UI/UX), to optimizing circuit design, to physical projects (such as building and designing a cardboard chair), the drawing of these designs have always been the highlight to each of my projects. Seeing a design come to life in physical/virtual form is what I enjoy most.</p>

                    <h4 class="center-text">Hardware Architecture & Verification</h4>
                    <p>One of my favourite courses in my program has been the Digital System Design courses (CPEN 211 and CPEN 311). Working with SystemVerilog and Assembly language has helped me understand computers at a level deeper than I had previously known. I enjoy solving and piecing together systems to form a working design. Modeling hardware programs using SystemVerilog and translating it physically onto my FPGA board has been one of the things I have enjoyed most within my university program.</p>

                    <h4 class="center-text">Problem Solving</h4>
                    <p>Problem solving has always been something I love doing. It presents a challenge that can have many different approaches to the solution. I oftenly spend generous amounts of time working on a problem until progress has been made. Most notibly, I enjoy solving problems on platforms like LeetCode, and HDLBits to hone my skills in algorithms and design.</p>
