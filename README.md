Hello, thank you for checking out my personal website! Please visit it here at [LouieTang.github.io](https://louietang.github.io/). I intend for this website to be regularly updated, such that I can exercise and display my html/css/js understanding and proficiency. For the moment, this is a static web page. For dynamic web pages and other projects please check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/LouieTang).

### Version 4 (Summer 2024)
This version of my website takes inspiration from the bento style UI/UX display trend that is currently circulating. Please check back regularly, some content is currently still in the process of being written (see [portfolio](https://louietang.github.io/#bento-portfolio)), and will be updated soon<sup>*TM*</sup>.

### Version 3 (Winter 2023)
Scrapped version, was in the works, however I got busy with school & research.

### Version 1/2 (Fall 2023)
Original webpage, plain html/css, a lot of information, if interested, please look through commits. Screenshots and documentation may be updated on current website soon<sup>*TM*</sup>.
